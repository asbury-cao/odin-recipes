  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>Bistek Tagalog is a classic Filipino dish made of thinly sliced beef braised in a mixture of citrus juice (more
    commonly, the local fruit, calamansi), soy sauce, onions, garlic, and pepper. A delicious medley of salty, tangy,
    and savory flavors, itâ€™s traditionally served with steamed rice.

  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2lbs of sirloin beef</li>
    <li>Red/White onions (either is fine but I prefer red since it's sweeter)</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon of sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon of salt</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons of soy sauce</li>
    <li>4 lemons</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Thaw beef and slice into thin strips</li>
    <li>Place in large bowl and add the sugar, salt, soy sauce, and lemons per
      portion sizes above</li>
    <li>Slice onions into thin rings</li>
    <li>Pour 2 tablespoons of cooking oil into a large pan</li>
    <li>Saute onions until brown then place them into the final serving dish plate</li>
    <li>Place beef and sauce mixture into same pan onions were cooked, starting on Low heat</li>
    <li>Raise heat up to Medium once all beef is in</li>
    <li>Fry beef on both sides until brown and caramelized and sauce is reduced
      (make sure to uncurl folded slices)</li>
    <li>Place only the meat into final serving dish and mix with onions</li>
    <li>With remaining sauce in pan, pour 1/2 cups of water in</li>
    <li>Allow the sauce to reduce and mix during the process</li>
    <li>Pour sauce onto beef and onions</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Done! Get some rice on that plate and pour some sauce on top and enjoy!</p>
