  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>A dish and cooking process native to the Philippines, adobo refers to the method of marinating meat, seafood, or
    vegetables (pretty much anything!) in a combination of soy sauce and vinegar. This marinade also includes other
    herbs and flavorings like garlic, bay leaves, and whole peppercorns.
  </p>

  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
    <li>3 whole peppers (around jalapeno spice level</li>
    <li>3/4 cup of vinegar</li>
    <li>1 cup of water</li>
    <li>1/4 cup of soy sauce</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon of salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon of sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon of peppercorn</li>
    <li>4 laurel leaf pieces</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps:</h3>
  <p>(Portions above are for 2 bags of chicken)</p>
  <p>(Also, if you want to have this with rice just have that cooking in the
    meantime as well)
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Place all ingredients in pot before heat. Order does not matter</li>
    <li>Put on Medium heat until boiling (approx. 20-25min) and cover with lid</li>
    <li>Don't undercook the vinegar by opening the lid early</li>
    <li>Once boiling, you can uncover pot and flip the chicken that hasn't been
      submerged by the sauce yet when checking
    </li>
    <li>Once 20-25mins are up, pour sauce into a container (any random Tupperware
      is fine) while leaving the chicken and rest of ingredients in pot
    </li>
    <li>Drizzle oil into pot and fry the chicken on Medium to Low heat until
      brown (get the skin crispy on both sides and be careful not to pull apart
      the wings when flipping)
    </li>
    <li>Pour the sauce back into the pot without lid and wait until sauce
      becomes thick (approx. 3-5min)
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Done! Get some rice on that plate and pour some sauce on top and enjoy!</p>
  <p>Note: You could take out the peppers and cut open on a saucer or small bowl
    with some fish sauce to dip the meat if preferred. (Might be too salty for
    some people lol)</p>
